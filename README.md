## Purpose

This club exists to share what we learn about various web3 technologies in a focused manner. The hope is that this will spread knowledge, build community, and provide incentive to keep reading interesting material.

## Club Format

* While it is encouraged to read the paper ahead of time, it is not required
* A summary of the paper will be given at the start of session
* The group asks clarifying questions to ensure that everyone has a working knowledge
* Feel free to use code examples, whiteboard drawings, interpretive dance, and so on

Only after the above, there is a broad discussion of:
* Advanatges
* Disadvantages
* Alternative approaches to the same problem(s)

### Ground Rules

* Please make an effort to stay on topic
* Be respectful to others both present and absent
* You may not present a paper written by you
  * Please _do_ submit your papers, and attend to provide clarity, though!

### This Club is _Not_...

* A pump n' dump forum
* A place to discuss token markets (beyond the scope of what is in the paper)
* A place to recruit developers
